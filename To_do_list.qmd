  - Implement the model in R, Python, or a combination, and ensure reproducibility.

- **Task 2: Model Explanation & Assumptions**
  - Clearly define all model components using mathematical notation and plain English explanations.
  - Discuss and document underlying assumptions, limitations, and potential issues.
  - Validate model performance using techniques like test/train splits, RMSE calculations, or sensitivity analyses.

- **Task 3: Results Section Write-Up**
  - Create tables, graphs, and visualizations to present the model's findings.
  - Write a clear and concise interpretation of the model results.

- **Task 4: Discussion Section Write-Up**

### **Person C: Appendices, Documentation & Reproducibility**
- **Task 1: Idealized Survey Design for Appendix B**
  - Design an ideal methodology and survey for forecasting the U.S. presidential election on a $100K budget.
  - Detail all aspects of the methodology (sampling approach, recruitment, data validation).
  - Create the survey on a platform like Google Forms, include a link in the appendix, and export the survey content as a PDF.

- **Task 2: Reproducible Workflow & Documentation**
  - Create an organized folder structure in the GitHub repo (e.g., `data/`, `scripts/`, `figures/`, `docs/`).
  - Write a detailed README file explaining the project, data sources, model, and workflow.
  - Document any use of LLMs or other tools, and include a separate usage text file if necessary.

- **Task 3: Final Paper Integration & Formatting**
  - Combine and format sections from all team members into a cohesive paper.
  - Add cross-references to all figures, tables, and equations.
  - Ensure all required sections are present and adhere to the rubric guidelines.

- **Task 4: Quality Checks & Submissions**
  - Proofread the paper for typos, grammar, and formatting issues.
  - Verify that all elements are properly cited (R, data sources, references).
  - Check that the paper, repo, and all files do not show any evidence of being a class project.
