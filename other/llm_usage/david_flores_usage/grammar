help me fix my grammar: "Lastly, we examine Democratic and Republican support alongside populations lean torwards Kamala Harris or Donald Trump over time, starting from july 21st when Joe Biden concluded his campaign, as reported by @globalnews2024. During this period, Democratic has been decreasing since the initial change to the day. Trump lost some support in september but has gained it back and surpassed kamala by early october. Close the the election, both democrats and republicans have similar points but support for trump and support for harris show that there is quite the difference.  By analyzing specific demographic factors and previous voting behavior, we aim to predict the 2024 election outcome."

Lastly, we examine Democratic and Republican support, along with the population's leanings toward Kamala Harris or Donald Trump over time, starting from July 21st, when Joe Biden concluded his campaign, as reported by @globalnews2024. During this period, Democratic support has been decreasing steadily since the initial change. Trump lost some support in September but gained it back, surpassing Kamala by early October. As the election approaches, both Democrats and Republicans have similar levels of overall support; however, the differences between support for Trump and Harris remain significant. By analyzing specific demographic factors and previous voting behavior, we aim to predict the 2024 election outcome.

Our model aims to forecast the voting outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, focusing specifically on eight pivotal swing states. We carefully selected predictor variables based on a correlation matrix we generated previously (see Figure @fig-predictors-party-pct).

## Model Design and Approach

We constructed two separate Bayesian linear models to estimate the percentage likelihood of Trump and Harris winning in each swing state. Using **brms** (@brms) for Bayesian regression modeling, our models included demographic and historical data, allowing us to generate probabilistic predictions for both candidates. These models provide insights into which candidate is more likely to secure a win, even in closely contested states.

## Key Components of Our Models

- **Outcome Variables**: The percentage of the popular vote each candidate is expected to receive.
- **Predictor Variables**: We include factors such as education level (e.g., college graduate vs. high school or less), gender distribution (male vs. female), and ethnic demographics (White or Caucasian vs. Hispanic or Latino). Additionally, historical voting patterns (e.g., 2020 voting preferences) and current leanings toward Trump or Harris are crucial predictors.
- **Model Structure**: Each model incorporates an intercept to represent baseline support and predictor coefficients to quantify the effect of each variable on the vote share.

## Assumptions Underlying Our Models

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between each predictor and vote share is assumed to be approximately linear.
2. **Independence**: We assume that vote share predictions for each state are independent, conditional on the included predictors.
3. **Non-Normality**: Given the non-normal distribution of our response variables, using a generalized linear model is more appropriate.
4. **Priors**: We applied weakly informative priors to regularize our predictions, with specific priors for those who voted for Trump and Biden in 2020, aligning with historical voting trends.

## Bayesian Modeling Implementation

The models were fit with four chains, running 6,000 iterations each, to ensure convergence and reliable posterior estimates. Sensible default priors were adjusted to reflect our prior knowledge about voting behavior, and we conducted posterior predictive checks to assess the models' performance."
