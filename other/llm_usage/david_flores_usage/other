create me r code that creates a dataframe frame with these columns: Date, State, Candidate A, Candidate B, Sample Size, Polling Methodology, Region type, Historical result, GDP, unemployment. Give me 10 rows for 10 of the states:"California","Texas","Florida","New York","Pennsylvania","Illinois","Ohio","Georgia","North Carolina","Michigan" and the dates range from June to august

Here is the R code to create a data frame with the specified columns for the top 10 U.S. states with dates ranging from June to August:

R
Copy code
# Load required library
library(tidyverse)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(853)

# Define states
states <- c(
  "California",
  "Texas",
  "Florida",
  "New York",
  "Pennsylvania",
  "Illinois",
  "Ohio",
  "Georgia",
  "North Carolina",
  "Michigan"
)

# Define other parameters
methodologies <- c("Phone", "Online", "Mixed")
region_types <- c("Urban", "Suburban", "Rural")

# Generate data
analysis_data <- data.frame(
  Date = seq(as.Date("2023-06-01"), as.Date("2023-08-31"), length.out = 10), # 10 dates from June to August
  State = states,
  Candidate_A = round(runif(10, 40, 60), 2), # Random support for Candidate A between 40 and 60%
  Candidate_B = round(runif(10, 40, 60), 2), # Random support for Candidate B between 40 and 60%
  Sample_Size = sample(500:2000, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random sample size between 500 and 2000
  Polling_Methodology = sample(methodologies, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random polling methodology
  Region_type = sample(region_types, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random region type
  Historical_result = round(runif(10, 45, 55), 2), # Random historical result between 45 and 55%
  GDP = round(runif(10, 1.0, 3.0), 2), # Random GDP growth rate between 1.0 and 3.0%
  Unemployment = round(runif(10, 3.0, 7.0), 2) # Random unemployment rate between 3.0 and 7.0%
)

# Print the dataframe
print(analysis_data)
This code will create a data frame with the columns and parameters specified. Each state will have a randomly assigned set of polling data within realistic ranges. Let me know if you need any changes!
