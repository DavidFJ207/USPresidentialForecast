David:
create me r code that creates a dataframe frame with these columns: Date, State, Candidate A, Candidate B, Sample Size, Polling Methodology, Region type, Historical result, GDP, unemployment. Give me 10 rows for 10 of the states:"California","Texas","Florida","New York","Pennsylvania","Illinois","Ohio","Georgia","North Carolina","Michigan" and the dates range from June to august

Here is the R code to create a data frame with the specified columns for the top 10 U.S. states with dates ranging from June to August:

R
Copy code
# Load required library
library(tidyverse)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(853)

# Define states
states <- c(
  "California",
  "Texas",
  "Florida",
  "New York",
  "Pennsylvania",
  "Illinois",
  "Ohio",
  "Georgia",
  "North Carolina",
  "Michigan"
)

# Define other parameters
methodologies <- c("Phone", "Online", "Mixed")
region_types <- c("Urban", "Suburban", "Rural")

# Generate data
analysis_data <- data.frame(
  Date = seq(as.Date("2023-06-01"), as.Date("2023-08-31"), length.out = 10), # 10 dates from June to August
  State = states,
  Candidate_A = round(runif(10, 40, 60), 2), # Random support for Candidate A between 40 and 60%
  Candidate_B = round(runif(10, 40, 60), 2), # Random support for Candidate B between 40 and 60%
  Sample_Size = sample(500:2000, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random sample size between 500 and 2000
  Polling_Methodology = sample(methodologies, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random polling methodology
  Region_type = sample(region_types, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random region type
  Historical_result = round(runif(10, 45, 55), 2), # Random historical result between 45 and 55%
  GDP = round(runif(10, 1.0, 3.0), 2), # Random GDP growth rate between 1.0 and 3.0%
  Unemployment = round(runif(10, 3.0, 7.0), 2) # Random unemployment rate between 3.0 and 7.0%
)

# Print the dataframe
print(analysis_data)
This code will create a data frame with the columns and parameters specified. Each state will have a randomly assigned set of polling data within realistic ranges. Let me know if you need any changes!

David: 
I want to make this simulation more intricate by introducing trends in the data. For example, I want the choice for President Trump to increase over time, and Joe Biden's disapproval to decrease. Safety concerns should trend toward feeling less safe, and the economic situation should worsen as time progresses. Past voting behavior should remain consistent, as should ethnicity, with Hispanics at around 15% and Whites close to 60%.


ChatGPT said:
To create more intricate trends in the simulation, we can adjust the random generation process to reflect trends in the data over time. Specifically, for each date, we will make:

Trump's approval increase over time.
Biden's disapproval decrease over time.
Safety concerns reflect a perceived decrease in safety.
Economic situation worsens over time.
Past voting behavior and ethnicity distribution remain consistent as specified.
Here's the code to achieve this:

Explanation of Changes
Trend Simulation with generate_trend Function:

Trump Presidential Choice: Increases linearly from 45% to 55%.
Biden Disapproval: Decreases linearly from 60% to 50%.
Safety Concerns (More Safe): Decreases from 40% to 30% to reflect worsening safety.
Economic Situation (Better): Decreases from 40% to 30% to reflect worsening conditions.
Random Noise for Realism:

Each trend has a small normal noise component (rnorm) to add variation across states and simulate a realistic polling dataset.
Consistent Past Voting and Ethnicity:

Past Voting Behavior: Set to a consistent average around 52% for Biden and the complement for Trump.
Ethnicity: Hispanic population remains around 15% and White population around 60%, with minor random fluctuations.
Trim Values:

Ensured all generated values stay within the valid percentage range of 0-100.
This approach gives each state multiple entries on specific dates, with a clear trend over time for selected variables, while maintaining consistency for past voting behavior and ethnicity.

David: 
help me write R code to validate a dataset for an American Election analysis? Here's what I need:
1. A section for loading the `tidyverse` package and reading in a CSV file called `simulated_poll_data.csv` using `read_csv()` from the `here` package.
2. A test to ensure the data was loaded successfully.
3. A check to make sure all column headers are unique.
4. A test to verify that the `state` column contains only valid American state names, including a list of all 50 states plus 'National.'
5. A check for any missing values in the entire dataset.
6. A test to ensure the dataset has at least 5 columns.
7. A validation to ensure every column contains at least one non-NA value.
8. A check to ensure that all columns have consistent data types (no mixed types in a single column).
9. A test to ensure the dataset has at least one row.
10. A validation to make sure all numeric columns contain non-negative values.
11. A check for any duplicate rows in the dataset.

Unique Column Headers: Ensures that column names are unique.
State Column Check: Validates that the state column contains only valid American state names.
Missing Values Check: Checks for any missing values in the dataset.
Column Count Check: Confirms that the dataset has at least 5 columns.
Non-NA Values: Ensures every column has at least one non-NA value.
Consistent Data Types: Checks that each column has a consistent data type.
Row Count Check: Makes sure the dataset has at least one row.
