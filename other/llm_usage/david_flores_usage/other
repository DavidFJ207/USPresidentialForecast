create me r code that creates a dataframe frame with these columns: Date, State, Candidate A, Candidate B, Sample Size, Polling Methodology, Region type, Historical result, GDP, unemployment. Give me 10 rows for 10 of the states:"California","Texas","Florida","New York","Pennsylvania","Illinois","Ohio","Georgia","North Carolina","Michigan" and the dates range from June to august

Here is the R code to create a data frame with the specified columns for the top 10 U.S. states with dates ranging from June to August:

R
Copy code
# Load required library
library(tidyverse)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(853)

# Define states
states <- c(
  "California",
  "Texas",
  "Florida",
  "New York",
  "Pennsylvania",
  "Illinois",
  "Ohio",
  "Georgia",
  "North Carolina",
  "Michigan"
)

# Define other parameters
methodologies <- c("Phone", "Online", "Mixed")
region_types <- c("Urban", "Suburban", "Rural")

# Generate data
analysis_data <- data.frame(
  Date = seq(as.Date("2023-06-01"), as.Date("2023-08-31"), length.out = 10), # 10 dates from June to August
  State = states,
  Candidate_A = round(runif(10, 40, 60), 2), # Random support for Candidate A between 40 and 60%
  Candidate_B = round(runif(10, 40, 60), 2), # Random support for Candidate B between 40 and 60%
  Sample_Size = sample(500:2000, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random sample size between 500 and 2000
  Polling_Methodology = sample(methodologies, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random polling methodology
  Region_type = sample(region_types, 10, replace = TRUE), # Random region type
  Historical_result = round(runif(10, 45, 55), 2), # Random historical result between 45 and 55%
  GDP = round(runif(10, 1.0, 3.0), 2), # Random GDP growth rate between 1.0 and 3.0%
  Unemployment = round(runif(10, 3.0, 7.0), 2) # Random unemployment rate between 3.0 and 7.0%
)

# Print the dataframe
print(analysis_data)
This code will create a data frame with the columns and parameters specified. Each state will have a randomly assigned set of polling data within realistic ranges. Let me know if you need any changes!

David: 
I want to make this simulation more intricate by introducing trends in the data. For example, I want the choice for President Trump to increase over time, and Joe Biden's disapproval to decrease. Safety concerns should trend toward feeling less safe, and the economic situation should worsen as time progresses. Past voting behavior should remain consistent, as should ethnicity, with Hispanics at around 15% and Whites close to 60%.


ChatGPT said:
To create more intricate trends in the simulation, we can adjust the random generation process to reflect trends in the data over time. Specifically, for each date, we will make:

Trump's approval increase over time.
Biden's disapproval decrease over time.
Safety concerns reflect a perceived decrease in safety.
Economic situation worsens over time.
Past voting behavior and ethnicity distribution remain consistent as specified.
Here's the code to achieve this:

write_csv(analysis_data, "data/00-simulated_data/simulated_poll_data_trend.csv")
Explanation of Changes
Trend Simulation with generate_trend Function:

Trump Presidential Choice: Increases linearly from 45% to 55%.
Biden Disapproval: Decreases linearly from 60% to 50%.
Safety Concerns (More Safe): Decreases from 40% to 30% to reflect worsening safety.
Economic Situation (Better): Decreases from 40% to 30% to reflect worsening conditions.
Random Noise for Realism:

Each trend has a small normal noise component (rnorm) to add variation across states and simulate a realistic polling dataset.
Consistent Past Voting and Ethnicity:

Past Voting Behavior: Set to a consistent average around 52% for Biden and the complement for Trump.
Ethnicity: Hispanic population remains around 15% and White population around 60%, with minor random fluctuations.
Trim Values:

Ensured all generated values stay within the valid percentage range of 0-100.
This approach gives each state multiple entries on specific dates, with a clear trend over time for selected variables, while maintaining consistency for past voting behavior and ethnicity.

David: 
help me write R code to validate a dataset for an American Election analysis? Here's what I need:
1. A section for loading the `tidyverse` package and reading in a CSV file called `simulated_poll_data.csv` using `read_csv()` from the `here` package.
2. A test to ensure the data was loaded successfully.
3. A check to make sure all column headers are unique.
4. A test to verify that the `state` column contains only valid American state names, including a list of all 50 states plus 'National.'
5. A check for any missing values in the entire dataset.
6. A test to ensure the dataset has at least 5 columns.
7. A validation to ensure every column contains at least one non-NA value.
8. A check to ensure that all columns have consistent data types (no mixed types in a single column).
9. A test to ensure the dataset has at least one row.
10. A validation to make sure all numeric columns contain non-negative values.
11. A check for any duplicate rows in the dataset.

David: 
I need to write a comprehensive set of tests for validating the structure, data types, consistency, and quality of a dataset related to the 2024 US presidential election poll data. The dataset includes columns like 'state,' 'party,' 'poll_id,' 'pct,' and 'end_date.' 

Could you generate R code using `testthat` that covers the following tests:

1. Check that the dataset has specific required columns.
2. Validate the data types of these columns (e.g., 'pct' should be numeric, 'state' and 'party' should be character, and 'end_date' should be a date).
3. Ensure 'state' only contains valid US state names and 'party' only has major political parties like 'Democrat' and 'Republican.'
4. Confirm that 'pct' values are percentages between 0 and 100.
5. Check for the absence of empty strings in 'state' and 'party' and ensure there are at least two unique parties.
6. Make sure the dates are within a logical range for the 2024 election period.
7. Verify there are no missing values in critical columns and no duplicate rows.
8. Assess that 'pct' values have reasonable statistical properties, such as mean percentages falling within a specific range for each state.

Please provide code in R that achieves this, using best practices for test writing and including appropriate error messages

Structure Tests: Ensures the dataset has all required columns.
Data Type Tests: Verifies each column has the expected data type.
Value Range Tests: Confirms valid state and party names and checks that 'pct' values are within the range of 0 to 100.
Consistency Checks: Ensures there are no empty strings and verifies diversity in party representation.
Date Validations: Ensures all dates fall within the expected range for the 2024 election.
Data Quality: Checks for missing values and duplicate rows.
Statistical Properties: Assesses that mean percentage values are within a realistic range.
