I need to model voting patterns using Bayesian regression in R for Democrat and Republican voters separately. Here’s what I’m trying to achieve:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Import data from a Parquet file and ensure the columns are named correctly.
   - Focus on specific predictor variables, like education, gender, ethnicity, and voting history.
   - Filter the data by party (DEM or REP) and make sure all predictor columns are numeric.
   - Scale the pct column to fit within the range (0, 1) for a Beta regression.

2. Model Specifications:
   - Use brms to create Bayesian regression models for each party.
   - For the Democrat model, set priors that specifically account for those who voted for Joe Biden in 2020.
   - For the Republican model, set priors that account for those who voted for Donald Trump in 2020.
   - Use a Beta distribution family for the regression and set up appropriate control parameters.

3. Saving the Models:
   - Save each fitted model as an RDS file for future use.

Could you write the R code for me with this setup? Make sure to include data filtering, scaling, model formulas, and any necessary priors.

Here's how you can structure your R code to model voting patterns using Bayesian regression for Democrats and Republicans separately:

#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Model voting patterns based on poll data for Democrat and Republican voters
# Author: Gadiel David Flores
# Date: 27 October 2024

#### Workspace Setup ####
library(here)
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(brms)

# Data Import
analysis_data <- read_parquet(here::here("data/02-analysis_data/timeline_data.parquet"))

#### Define Predictor Columns ####
predictor_columns <- c(
  "What is the highest level of education you have attained? College graduate",
  "What is the highest level of education you have attained? High school or less",
  "Can you please tell me your gender? Female",
  "Can you please tell me your gender? Male",
  "For statistical purposes only, can you please tell me your ethnicity? White or Caucasian",
  "For statistical purposes only, can you please tell me your ethnicity? Hispanic or Latino of any race",
  "Although you are undecided, which candidate do you lean toward? Donald Trump",
  "Although you are undecided, which candidate do you lean toward? Kamala Harris",
  "Who did you vote for in the 2020 election? Donald Trump",
  "Who did you vote for in the 2020 election? Joe Biden"
)

#### Data Preparation ####

# Rename columns to be compatible with brms
names(analysis_data) <- make.names(names(analysis_data))
predictor_columns <- make.names(predictor_columns)

# Function to scale `pct` for Beta regression
scale_pct <- function(data) {
  epsilon <- 1e-6
  data %>%
    mutate(
      pct_scaled = (pct / 100) * (1 - 2 * epsilon) + epsilon
    )
}

#### Model Setup for Democrat Voters ####

# Filter for Democrats and prepare data
analysis_data_dem <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(party == "DEM") %>%
  scale_pct() %>%
  select(all_of(c("pct_scaled", predictor_columns))) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%
  na.omit()

# Create the formula
predictor_formula <- paste(predictor_columns, collapse = " + ")
formula_dem <- as.formula(paste("pct_scaled ~", predictor_formula))

# Specify priors for Democrat model
priors_dem <- c(
  prior(normal(0, 5), class = "b"),
  prior(normal(0, 1), class = "b", coef = "Who.did.you.vote.for.in.the.2020.election..Joe.Biden"),
  prior(beta(1, 1), class = "phi")
)

# Fit the Democrat model
dem_model <- brm(
  formula = formula_dem,
  data = analysis_data_dem,
  family = Beta(),
  prior = priors_dem,
  chains = 4,
  iter = 6000,
  warmup = 2000,
  cores = 4,
  seed = 123,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.9, max_treedepth = 15)
)

### Save the Democrat Model ###
if (!dir.exists("models")) {
  dir.create("models")
}
saveRDS(dem_model, file = "models/bayesian_model_dem.rds")

#### Model Setup for Republican Voters ####

# Filter for Republicans and prepare data
analysis_data_rep <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(party == "REP") %>%
  scale_pct() %>%
  select(all_of(c("pct_scaled", predictor_columns))) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%
  na.omit()

# Create the formula
formula_rep <- as.formula(paste("pct_scaled ~", predictor_formula))

# Specify priors for Republican model
priors_rep <- c(
  prior(normal(0, 5), class = "b"),
  prior(normal(0, 1), class = "b", coef = "Who.did.you.vote.for.in.the.2020.election..Donald.Trump"),
  prior(beta(1, 1), class = "phi")
)

# Fit the Republican model
rep_model <- brm(
  formula = formula_rep,
  data = analysis_data_rep,
  family = Beta(),
  prior = priors_rep,
  chains = 4,
  iter = 6000,
  warmup = 2000,
  cores = 4,
  seed = 123,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.9, max_treedepth = 15)
)

### Save the Republican Model ###
saveRDS(rep_model, file = "models/bayesian_model_rep.rds")
Explanation of the Code:
Data Preparation:

The analysis_data is imported from a Parquet file and renamed to make column names compatible with R.
The scale_pct function scales the pct column to be within the range (0, 1), suitable for Beta regression.
The data is filtered by party (DEM or REP), and only relevant predictor columns are selected and converted to numeric.
Model Setup and Specifications:

Separate Bayesian models are created for Democrat and Republican voters using the brms package.
Priors are set, particularly for the voting history of Joe Biden (for Democrats) and Donald Trump (for Republicans).
The Beta family is used for the regression, with control parameters set for efficient sampling.
Model Fitting and Saving:

The models are saved as RDS files in a "models" directory for future use.
Feel free to adjust the priors or the control settings as needed for your analysis!
